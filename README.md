## General info
This project aims at forecasting powerplant energy constrains, i.e. minimum energy and maximum power / energy based on historical data using machine learning techniques.

This is a multivariate regression problem whith a timeseries dimension whose predictions must respect a number of constrains, which makes it unusual and challenging.

## Project presentation
Check out the project with a [short presentation](https://prezi.com/view/MN8KaQc64dhc0l4obrXZ/), introducing the approach used and obtained results.

## Technologies
Project is implemented in Jupyter notebooks using Python.
